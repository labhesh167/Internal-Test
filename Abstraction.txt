Question: Describe the concept of abstraction in OOP and provide an example of how it is used in Java.

--> Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the concept of hiding the complex details of how something works and showing only the necessary parts. It's like when you drive a carâ€”you just need to know how to operate it, but you don't need to understand how the engine works internally.
    In programming, abstraction helps simplify code by focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it.
    In Java, abstraction is often achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

    Code:
        abstract class Vehicle 
        {
            abstract void start(); 

        void stop() 
        {
            System.out.println("Vehicle is stopping");
        }
        }

        class Car extends Vehicle {
        @Override
        void start() 
        {
        System.out.println("Car is starting with key ignition");
        }
}

        class Bike extends Vehicle 
        {
        @Override
        void start() 
        {
        System.out.println("Bike is starting with electric start");
        }
}
